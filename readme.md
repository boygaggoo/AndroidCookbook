# My Personal Android Cookbook

Here are trivial problems yet most of times I forget how to code it:
- Getting Bitmap from ImageView
- Saving Image to Storage
- Checking device Internet availability
- Converting pixel to dp
- Calculating distance between two lat, lan points
- The list goes on...
 
I'm tired of scrapping answer from StackOverflow or my previous projects source code.
Instead I create this "cookbook" so that I only need to open this project to solve those problem.
The docs wasn't complete, however I tried my best to make my source self-explanatory.

I hope this project is useful for you, feel free to email me if you need help.
Thanks.
